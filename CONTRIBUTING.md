## Reporting Issues

If you encounter a bug or issue:

1. Check our [issues](https://github.com/shmaplex/nous/issues) to see if it’s already reported.  
2. If not, create a new issue with a clear title and description. Include:
   - Steps to reproduce the issue  
   - Expected vs actual behavior  
   - Screenshots, logs, or errors if relevant  

We will respond as quickly as possible, though initial launch priorities may affect timing.

## Feature Requests

1. Search existing issues to avoid duplicates.  
2. Open a new issue and clearly describe:
   - The problem you want solved

   - Any potential alternatives or considerations  

Feature requests will be reviewed and prioritized by the core team.
